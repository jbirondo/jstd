Background

Tower defense (TD) is a subgenre of strategy video game where the goal is to defend a player's territories or possessions by obstructing the enemy attackers, usually achieved by placing defensive structures on or along their path of attack. In JS TD, there will be a path on which enemies will run and and towers will be placed along the path to defeat the enemies. Each wave of enemies will increase in difficulty to defeat.

Functionality & MVP
In JS TD, users will be able to:

- Click and drag towers to positions on the canvas
- Upgrade towers attributes depending on users available money
- Unlock different towers with different abilities depending users available money


In addition, this project will include:
A production README
